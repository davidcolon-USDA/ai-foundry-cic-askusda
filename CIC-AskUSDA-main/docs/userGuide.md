Click one of the suggested questions, for example:

### Step 4: View the Response

When the bot replies:

1. A **typing indicator** (e.g. animated dots) shows while it’s thinking.
2. The **answer streams in progressively** — you'll see text appearing as it's generated (formatted with markdown: lists, links, etc.).
3. **Citations** (source links) are shown below the answer when the response completes.

---

### Step 5: Use Citations and Sources

After many answers, you’ll see a **Sources** or **Citations** section with links to usda.gov and farmers.gov pages.

- **Web links**: Click a citation to open the source page in a new tab.
- Use these links to confirm details (program names, deadlines, contact info, etc.).

---

### Step 6: Give Feedback

You can rate each bot response:

1. Find the **👍** (thumbs up) and **👎** (thumbs down) buttons below the response.
2. Click **thumbs up** if the answer was helpful.
3. Click **thumbs down** if it was unhelpful or wrong.

Your feedback is used to improve the chatbot.

### Step 7: Contact Support (Optional)

For questions the chatbot can’t answer or when you need human follow-up:

1. Click the **✉️ mail / contact** icon (e.g. in the chat header or footer).

3. Fill in:
   - **Name**

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Be specific**: “What farm loan programs exist for beginning farmers?” tends to work better than “Tell me about loans.”
- **Use follow-ups**: The chatbot keeps context within the conversation, so you can ask follow-up questions.
- **Check citations**: For important decisions (eligibility, deadlines, applications), open the source links and confirm on usda.gov or farmers.gov.
- **Use suggested questions**: They’re tuned to common USDA topics and can speed things up.
- **Give feedback**: Use 👍/👎 so the team can improve answers.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Q: How accurate is the chatbot’s information?

**A:** The chatbot uses content from usda.gov and farmers.gov and cites sources. Always confirm important details (eligibility, deadlines, application steps) via the citation links or by contacting USDA directly.

### Q: Can I apply for programs or loans through the chatbot?

**A:** No. The chatbot only provides information. It will point you to official application pages, forms, or contact info. You must complete applications through those official channels.

### Q: Why does the chatbot say it doesn’t know something?

**A:** It only answers from its indexed USDA/farmers.gov content. If your question is outside that, or the info isn’t in the knowledge base, it will say so. Use **Contact Support** to reach a person.

### Q: Is my conversation private?

**A:** Conversations may be stored for analytics and improvement. Information you submit in the support form is used to follow up with you and is handled according to USDA privacy practices.

### Q: How do I report a wrong or unhelpful answer?

**A:** Click the **👎** (thumbs down) button on that response. This feedback is used to improve the chatbot.

### Q: Can I continue a conversation later?

**A:** Conversation history is kept only for your current browser session. If you close the tab or refresh, the history is cleared. You can start a new chat anytime.

## Troubleshooting

### The chatbot isn’t responding

- Check your internet connection.
- Refresh the page and try again.
- Clear cache or try a different browser if the issue continues.
- The service may be temporarily unavailable; try again later.

### Responses are slow

- Complex questions can take a few seconds.
- Check your connection speed.
- Try a shorter or simpler question to see if replies come through.

### Citations or links don’t work

- Ensure pop-ups aren’t blocked for the app’s domain.
- Click the link again; some sources may load slowly.
- If a link is broken, use the chatbot’s **Contact Support** to report it.

### Support form submission failed

- Make sure **name**, **email**, and **question** are filled in.
- Use a valid email address.
- Try again in a few moments. If it still fails, contact your system administrator.
